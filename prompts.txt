Create a sleek, modern landing page for a company called "AI Swiss Knife". Itâ€™s a smart, all-purpose AI tool for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The page should feel innovative and trustworthy, with a touch of playful confidence â€” think Apple meets Notion, but with an AI twist.

Use:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React (Vite project)
- Framer Motion for smooth animations (fade-ins, scroll-ins)
- A clear hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA button ("Book a Call")
- A Calendly link or embed to book a meeting
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Modular components and clean code

Style tone:
- White space is power
- Rounded corners, soft shadows
- Smooth hover effects
- Font should feel sharp but friendly (use system fonts for now)
- Keep colors minimal â€” mostly black/white with one bold accent (blue or pink)

Give me the code for a complete first version of the page, ideally in a few clean React components.

You're working with an existing Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project for a landing page called "AI Swiss Knife".

ðŸ§© Current structure:
- Main file: `src/pages/Home.jsx`
- Entry point: `src/main.jsx`
- Tailwind is already configured and working
- Framer Motion is installed
- The current layout is basic: header text, hero title, subheadline, a "Book a Call" link, and footer
- I have a logo file called `aisk.png` in the `public/` folder
- The Calendly booking link is: https://calendly.com/frederic-brunner

ðŸŽ¯ I want to significantly improve the design and layout:

---

âœ… 1. **Header Improvements**
- Replace the current header with a reusable `Header.jsx` component in `src/components/`
- Make the header sticky and modern (like [relevanceai.com](https://relevanceai.com/)) with:
  - The logo `ressources/aisk-logo.png` on the left
  - Smooth scroll behavior (if we later add more sections)
  - Transparent background with slight blur or white background on scroll (feel free to use Tailwind's `backdrop-blur` or a conditional class)
  - Navigation space prepared (even if no links yet â€” just some visual spacing)

âœ… 2. **Redesign the Hero Section**
- In `Home.jsx`, create a centered layout with:
  - Large, bold headline like: `Your AI Swiss Army Knife`
  - Subheadline: `A versatile AI tool for entrepreneurs and small businesses.`
  - CTA button with text `Book a Call`, linking to the Calendly URL
  - Proper vertical spacing so that this section fills the viewport height (`min-h-screen` with flex centering)
  - Use Framer Motion to animate the entry of the headline, subheadline, and button (slide-up + fade-in with delays)

âœ… 3. **Add a Red-Accent Swiss Design Vibe**
- Overall design should be clean, lots of white space, inspired by the Swiss flag
- Use a bold red (`#e30613` or Tailwind `red-600`) as the primary accent color:
  - Button background
  - Hover states
  - Small dividers or lines if needed
- Keep fonts and layout minimal â€” think modern, elegant precision (like Helvetica-inspired design)
- Rounded buttons, subtle shadows, hover transitions

âœ… 4. **Centering & Layout Fixes**
- Make sure all sections are properly centered both vertically and horizontally
- Ensure mobile responsiveness â€” everything should stack and look natural on small screens
- Use max-width constraints (`max-w-3xl`, `mx-auto`, etc.) to keep content from stretching too wide

âœ… 5. **Footer**
- Keep or slightly polish the footer
- It should have a light gray text, simple, centered, e.g. `Â© 2025 AI Swiss Knife`

âœ… 6. **Component Structure**
- Move repeated or large chunks of JSX into separate components in `src/components/`:
  - `Header.jsx`
  - (Optional later: `Hero.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`)

âœ… 7. **Optional Enhancements**
- Use a Google Font (like Inter or Open Sans) via `index.html` for better typography
- Add a favicon with the Swiss cross if desired
