Create a sleek, modern landing page for a company called "AI Swiss Knife". It’s a smart, all-purpose AI tool for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The page should feel innovative and trustworthy, with a touch of playful confidence — think Apple meets Notion, but with an AI twist.

Use:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React (Vite project)
- Framer Motion for smooth animations (fade-ins, scroll-ins)
- A clear hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA button ("Book a Call")
- A Calendly link or embed to book a meeting
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Modular components and clean code

Style tone:
- White space is power
- Rounded corners, soft shadows
- Smooth hover effects
- Font should feel sharp but friendly (use system fonts for now)
- Keep colors minimal — mostly black/white with one bold accent (blue or pink)

Give me the code for a complete first version of the page, ideally in a few clean React components.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You're working with an existing Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project for a landing page called "AI Swiss Knife".

🧩 Current structure:
- Main file: `src/pages/Home.jsx`
- Entry point: `src/main.jsx`
- Tailwind is already configured and working
- Framer Motion is installed
- The current layout is basic: header text, hero title, subheadline, a "Book a Call" link, and footer
- I have a logo file called `aisk.png` in the `public/` folder
- The Calendly booking link is: https://calendly.com/frederic-brunner

🎯 I want to significantly improve the design and layout:

---

✅ 1. **Header Improvements**
- Replace the current header with a reusable `Header.jsx` component in `src/components/`
- Make the header sticky and modern (like [relevanceai.com](https://relevanceai.com/)) with:
  - The logo `ressources/aisk-logo.png` on the left
  - Smooth scroll behavior (if we later add more sections)
  - Transparent background with slight blur or white background on scroll (feel free to use Tailwind's `backdrop-blur` or a conditional class)
  - Navigation space prepared (even if no links yet — just some visual spacing)

✅ 2. **Redesign the Hero Section**
- In `Home.jsx`, create a centered layout with:
  - Large, bold headline like: `Your AI Swiss Army Knife`
  - Subheadline: `A versatile AI tool for entrepreneurs and small businesses.`
  - CTA button with text `Book a Call`, linking to the Calendly URL
  - Proper vertical spacing so that this section fills the viewport height (`min-h-screen` with flex centering)
  - Use Framer Motion to animate the entry of the headline, subheadline, and button (slide-up + fade-in with delays)

✅ 3. **Add a Red-Accent Swiss Design Vibe**
- Overall design should be clean, lots of white space, inspired by the Swiss flag
- Use a bold red (`#e30613` or Tailwind `red-600`) as the primary accent color:
  - Button background
  - Hover states
  - Small dividers or lines if needed
- Keep fonts and layout minimal — think modern, elegant precision (like Helvetica-inspired design)
- Rounded buttons, subtle shadows, hover transitions

✅ 4. **Centering & Layout Fixes**
- Make sure all sections are properly centered both vertically and horizontally
- Ensure mobile responsiveness — everything should stack and look natural on small screens
- Use max-width constraints (`max-w-3xl`, `mx-auto`, etc.) to keep content from stretching too wide

✅ 5. **Footer**
- Keep or slightly polish the footer
- It should have a light gray text, simple, centered, e.g. `© 2025 AI Swiss Knife`

✅ 6. **Component Structure**
- Move repeated or large chunks of JSX into separate components in `src/components/`:
  - `Header.jsx`
  - (Optional later: `Hero.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`)

✅ 7. **Optional Enhancements**
- Use a Google Font (like Inter or Open Sans) via `index.html` for better typography
- Add a favicon with the Swiss cross if desired

below the Hero section I want to create pain points section with the following:

You're an expert at managing your clients' finances. But finding time to consistently attract new business? That's where most accounting professionals struggle.

You spend precious evenings and weekends trying to grow your practice when you should be resting or with family.

You watch less qualified competitors win clients simply because they're better at marketing themselves.

Your reliance on word-of-mouth and referrals creates unpredictable revenue cycles that keep you awake at night.

During busy tax seasons, you're too swamped to follow up with potential prospects—exactly when they need you most.

You've wasted money on ineffective networking events and local advertising with poor ROI.

And worst of all: you have no systematic way to track which business development efforts actually work.

It's not your fault. You were trained to be an exceptional accountant, not a marketing expert.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now let's add a solution section: 
Transform Your Practice Growth Without Sacrificing Your Standards
What if you could implement a client acquisition system that works 24/7, even during your busiest tax seasons?

Imagine checking your inbox each morning to find conversations with pre-qualified prospects who actually need your services—all without you having to spend hours on marketing activities.

That's exactly what our AISK CustomerCenter System delivers for Swiss accounting professionals like you.

Take Thomas from Zürich, for example. As a senior tax advisor with over 20 years of experience, he was excellent at serving clients but struggled to grow his practice consistently. Within just 6 weeks of implementing our system, he generated 8 new client conversations and converted 4 into long-term engagements—adding over CHF 45,000 in annual recurring revenue while reducing his marketing time by over 90%.

The secret? A Swiss-engineered approach that combines precision targeting, cultural calibration, and ethical automation—all aligned with the professional standards and privacy requirements you uphold

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: Why choose our system instead of hiring an SDR?
The brutal truth about hiring an SDR: You'll pay a minimum of CHF 9,000/month for a single good SDR—and that's just the beginning. Factor in benefits, severance packages, training time, and management overhead, and your real cost skyrockets.

Our system delivers 17X the output at a fraction of the cost.

What's more—with an SDR, you're gambling. Even after investing months in hiring and training, there's zero guarantee they'll perform. They get sick. They take vacations. They quit unexpectedly.

Our Swiss-engineered system works 24/7/365, never asks for a raise, and consistently outperforms human SDRs for businesses under CHF 3M in annual revenue.

"I replaced our two-person SDR team with AI Swiss Knife and doubled our qualified leads while cutting costs by 60%. This wasn't even a difficult decision in hindsight." — Marc L., Financial Services

q: How much more cost-effective is this system, really?
Let's put actual numbers to this:

• Hiring in-house: You're paying approximately CHF 108,000/year minimum in salary alone for a single SDR. Add 25-40% for benefits, recruitment costs, management time, and equipment.

• Hiring an agency: Typically CHF 6,000-8,000/month with inconsistent results and constant turnover of your account managers.

• Our service: Just 30% of the cost of building an in-house team and 70% of what agencies charge—with significantly better results and zero management headaches.

Plus, you're not just getting a lead generation tool. You gain direct access to two operations executives who've helped scale multiple 8-figure companies. Try getting that level of strategic insight from a junior SDR or agency account manager.

All backed by our 100% satisfaction guarantee—something no recruitment agency or in-house hire will ever offer you.

How does payment work?
We've made billing as frictionless as our results:

Simply select your preferred payment option above
You'll be directed to our secure Stripe Checkout page
After payment, your subscription is automatically created
Billing renews on the same calendar day each month
Since our pricing is primarily results-based, you only pay for actual performance. You can pause or cancel your subscription anytime—no lengthy contracts, no hidden termination fees.

How quickly will I see actual results?
While others waste your time, we waste none.

Most lead generation agencies burn your first 2-3 weeks on "domain warm-up" and "infrastructure setup"—administrative busywork that postpones actual results while they bill you anyway.

Our approach is radically different:

• System setup completed in just 2-3 business days • First qualified leads begin arriving within 3-5 days • Positive ROI typically achieved within the first month

We've engineered our entire process to eliminate delays. No excuses, no "it takes time to build momentum" stalling tactics—just rapid, measurable results that impact your bottom line immediately.

What's your refund policy?
We don't succeed unless you do. Period.

If you're not 100% satisfied with our service, we keep working entirely at our expense until you are. This isn't a vague promise—it's our contractual commitment.

During any notice period, we'll work diligently to address your concerns rather than simply processing a refund. Why? Because our business depends on your success, not just collecting payments.

No other option—whether hiring in-house or through an agency—offers this level of performance guarantee.

last section let's remove the feature section and instead put a CTA section with:

Book a call with AI Swiss Knife founder Frederic Brunner - 30 years of experience in the software industry.
Quote "'If you're going to do something, do it properly or go back to making cheese.' my grandmother used to say. While I still make a decent Gruyère on weekends, during the week we're focused on being the growth partners that Swiss businesses can actually count on."
